      <h1>Challenging Andy Barr's DEI Attack</h1>
      <p>Questions for a just future</p>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> February 2026</p>
      <p>
        In February 2026, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr (R‑KY) released a television ad attacking
        diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. In the ad he asks viewers,
        "You know what DEI really stands for? Dumb, Evil, Indoctrination," then declares
        he will end this "trash" and insists "it's not a sin to be white, it's not against
        the law to be male, and it shouldn't be disqualifying to be a Christian." The
        rhetoric portrays DEI as a threat to white, male and Christian Americans, implying
        that programs designed to broaden opportunities are somehow harmful or discriminatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        But beyond the soundbite, the ad raises deeper questions about justice and the kind
        of future we want to build as a society. Here are some facts worth considering—and
        questions readers might ask themselves when evaluating Barr's message.
      </p>

      <h2>Unemployment and economic disparity</h2>
      <p>
        According to data from late 2025, Black workers faced an unemployment rate of
        7.5 percent, nearly double the 3.8 percent rate for white workers. When the labor
        market weakens, Black workers are typically the first fired and last hired. Income
        disparities follow suit: the median income for Black households in 2024 was $56,020,
        compared with $88,010 for white households, a gap of more than 36 percent. Black
        workers earn less than white workers in almost every major industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        These numbers aren't just statistics—each percentage point represents families
        striving to stay afloat, children who may lack access to quality education, and
        communities with fewer opportunities. How do these disparities reflect on claims
        that DEI is unnecessary or "evil"? If DEI programs attempt to address injustice
        and build a better future by leveling an uneven playing field, is it accurate to
        paint them as harmful?
      </p>

      <h2>Education gaps and opportunity</h2>
      <p>
        Education is a key driver of economic mobility, yet only 39 percent of Black adults
        in the United States have attained an associate degree or higher, compared with
        52.9 percent of white adults. Lower educational attainment limits access to
        high‑paying jobs and career advancement. What happens to opportunity when fewer
        people can access higher education? Without targeted support to help those who have
        been historically excluded from colleges and universities, are we perpetuating these
        disparities rather than solving them?
      </p>

      <h2>Contradictory voting record</h2>
      <p>
        Barr's campaign frames him as the anti‑DEI candidate, yet in 2019 he voted with
        225 Democrats for H.R. 5084, the Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity
        Act, which required publicly traded companies to disclose the racial, ethnic and
        gender composition of their leadership. The measure aimed to increase transparency
        around diversity in corporate leadership
        (<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2019630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">House Vote 630, 2019</a>).
        If DEI is so "evil," why support
        legislation that encourages it? Was his vote a mistake, or is his current stance
        a political calculation designed to energize a particular base?
      </p>

      <h2>Questions for reflection</h2>
      <p>Rather than accept campaign slogans at face value, it may be more productive to ask thoughtful questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What exactly is "evil" about efforts to achieve justice and build a better future
          by reducing unemployment and income gaps? When Black unemployment is nearly twice
          that of white unemployment, why is it wrong to build programs that aim to remedy
          injustice and create a more hopeful future?
        </li>
        <li>
          Does supporting DEI mean punishing white, male or Christian Americans? No credible
          DEI initiative suggests that any identity is sinful. Are claims of persecution
          distractions from the real issues of inequality and access?
        </li>
        <li>
          How should we build a better future and address inequities without DEI? If we
          dismantle DEI, what tools will remain to tackle the structural causes of economic
          and educational disparities? Who will develop and implement solutions if our
          leaders dismiss the very programs designed to help?
        </li>
        <li>
          Who benefits when we oppose transparency? Barr previously voted for corporate
          diversity reporting. If we abandon those measures now, who gains? Those already
          in power or the communities facing barriers to advancement?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A call for honest dialogue</h2>
      <p>
        Barr's ad may appeal to frustrations with "wokeness," but the real issues of
        justice and building a better future demand more than slogans. It's not a sin to
        be white, male or Christian—nor is it a sin to be Black, female or non‑Christian.
        The question is whether our society will work toward a more just and equitable
        future for everyone or allow persistent inequities to remain unaddressed. By asking
        ourselves hard questions and looking at the facts, we can move beyond culture‑war
        rhetoric toward genuine solutions that uplift everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        And one final, personal query: regardless of your own religious beliefs — or taking
        a moment to reflect on them — what would be the right thing to do? Many faith
        traditions emphasize justice, compassion and uplifting the marginalized. How might
        those principles guide your view of programs aimed at reducing inequality? Sitting
        with that question can help bring the conversation back to shared values and moral
        clarity.
