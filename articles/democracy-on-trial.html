      <h1>Democracy on Trial</h1>
      <p>Trump’s felony convictions and the future of the Republic</p>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> January 12, 2025</p>
      <p>
        In May 2024, a Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty of 34 counts of
        falsifying business records to conceal hush‑money payments designed to
        influence the 2016 election. The verdict marked the first time a former
        or sitting U.S. president had been convicted of a felony. After his
        unexpected victory in the 2024 presidential election, the courts faced
        an unprecedented question: how to sentence a president‑elect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer came slowly. In November 2024, Judge Juan Merchan
        indefinitely postponed Trump’s sentencing at the request of both
        prosecutors and the defense, noting that it would be improper to
        prosecute a sitting president【608087309335760†L50-L58】. The delay
        underscored the extraordinary nature of the case — a man convicted of
        felonies poised to take the oath of office.
      </p>
      <p>
        On January 10 2025, Judge Merchan finally issued a sentence: an
        unconditional discharge. Trump was formally sentenced on 34 felony
        counts but received no fines, probation or jail time【243535598315752†L47-L58】. The
        court concluded that any punishment could impede the president‑elect’s
        ability to govern【243535598315752†L55-L58】. The conviction remains on
        the record【243535598315752†L97-L103】, but Trump immediately promised an
        appeal.
      </p>
      <h2>What this means for democracy</h2>
      <p>
        Regardless of one’s political affiliation, the spectacle of a convicted
        felon assuming the presidency is jarring. It highlights a profound
        tension between the rule of law and the will of the electorate. The fact
        that nearly half of voters chose to return Trump to the White House
        despite the guilty verdict【243535598315752†L142-L146】 reveals how deeply
        divided the nation has become. It also exposes weaknesses in our
        institutions: the Constitution does not bar felons from serving as
        president, and our legal system offers few tools for holding a president
        accountable while in office.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet the lesson of this moment is not cynicism; it is vigilance. When
        leaders stand above the law, democracy loses its rhythm. As the “We Rise”
        manifesto reminds us, authoritarianism begins with excuses and grows
        through complacency【819044182704204†L137-L159】. Our task is to speak up,
        to insist that no office grants immunity from truth, and to demand
        institutions that can withstand charismatic figures who believe
        themselves untouchable.
      </p>
      <h2>A call to rise</h2>
      <p>
        None of this requires hatred or hostility; it requires clarity. Trump’s
        legal troubles are a fact, not an attack. The appropriate response is
        renewed commitment to democratic norms: electing leaders of integrity,
        strengthening ethical safeguards, and supporting an independent
        judiciary. We must also reimagine civic engagement. Talk to your
        neighbors, attend local council meetings, support journalism, and vote
        in every election. If we stay seated when the powerful twist the law to
        suit themselves, we become accomplices. If we rise, we become the
        guardians of the republic.
