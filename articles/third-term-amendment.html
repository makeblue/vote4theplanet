      <h1>A Third Term?</h1>
      <p>The resolution to rewrite the Constitution for one man</p>
    </header>

      <p><strong>Published:</strong> February 3, 2025</p>
      <p>
        On January 23, 2025, Representative Andrew Ogles (R‑Tenn.) introduced
        House Joint Resolution 29, a proposed constitutional amendment that
        would allow a person to be elected president up to three times【29126456628951†L169-L184】.
        Under the proposal, presidents who have served two consecutive terms
        would still be barred from seeking a third term, effectively carving
        out an exception for Donald Trump, who did not serve consecutive terms
        and could therefore run again in 2028【29126456628951†L178-L185】.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resolution highlights a tension between ambition and restraint.
        Since the ratification of the 22nd Amendment in 1951, presidents have
        accepted the two‑term limit as a safeguard against entrenched power.
        Constitutional scholars Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt warn that
        departures from this norm are “unwise, unpatriotic and fraught with
        peril to our free institutions,” as quoted in the Democratic Erosion
        Consortium’s February 2025 briefing【65427109828409†L96-L104】.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historical precedent suggests the amendment is unlikely to pass. More
        than 12,000 amendments have been proposed since 1789, but only 27 have
        been ratified【29126456628951†L199-L212】. Amendments must win two‑thirds
        approval in both chambers of Congress and be ratified by 38 states —
        an intentionally steep climb【29126456628951†L214-L238】. In recent
        decades, proposed amendments ranging from a balanced budget to term
        limits for members of Congress have stalled long before reaching
        ratification【29126456628951†L214-L219】.

      <h2>Why term limits matter</h2>
      <p>
        Term limits protect democracy by preventing any one person from
        accumulating too much power. They encourage leadership renewal and
        create space for new voices. Efforts to make exceptions for favored
        candidates erode the principle that no individual is indispensable.
        The norm of institutional forbearance — the self‑imposed restraint
        that prevents officials from using legal but dangerous powers — is a
        pillar of liberal democracy. When politicians start rewriting the
        rules to benefit themselves, they send a signal that power matters
        more than principle.
      </p>
      <h2>A challenge and a choice</h2>
      <p>
        Representative Ogles’s resolution is unlikely to succeed, but it
        illustrates the growing willingness to test constitutional limits. As
        citizens, we must pay attention to these maneuvers and respond not
        with outrage but with resolve. Support civic education that explains
        why term limits exist. Push your representatives to reject any
        amendment that opens the door to limitless leadership. Remind your
        community that democracy is not a spectator sport: we must guard it
        together【819044182704204†L169-L206】.
      </p>
      <p>
        Echoing the “We Rise” call to stand, we remember that silence is not
        unity; it is surrender【819044182704204†L169-L178】. The promise of
        America was never “Trust the powerful,” but “We the People”【819044182704204†L287-L301】.
        In that spirit, let us rise to defend the guardrails that keep power
        in check.
