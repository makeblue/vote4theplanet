      <h1>Project 2025</h1>
      <p>The Christian nationalist blueprint threatening American freedom</p>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> March 1, 2025</p>
      <p>
        In July 2024, the Interfaith Alliance published a detailed analysis of
        “Project 2025,” a sweeping policy manifesto authored by the Heritage
        Foundation and more than one hundred conservative groups. The
        922‑page plan lays out hundreds of executive actions and policy
        recommendations aimed at consolidating power in the presidency and
        reshaping the federal government along a narrow religious and
        ideological line【364449537505205†L128-L145】. Although the plan is not
        officially tied to any campaign, 32 of its 38 authors served in the
        previous Trump administration【364449537505205†L138-L141】.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project 2025’s goals are explicit: concentrate power in the executive,
        achieve long‑held conservative priorities and pursue a hardline
        religious‑right agenda【364449537505205†L142-L145】. Its authors argue
        that U.S. law should be informed by Christian nationalist teachings
        and morality【364449537505205†L147-L156】. The document calls for
        restrictions on reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ rights and seeks to
        blur the boundaries between church and state【364449537505205†L160-L166】.
      </p>
      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        Religious freedom is not the freedom of one group to impose its
        worldview on everyone else. It is the promise that people of all
        beliefs can live and worship without government interference.
        Project 2025 would undermine this principle by prioritising one
        theological perspective at the expense of others【364449537505205†L116-L119】.
        Americans of diverse faiths and none have a stake in preserving a
        secular, pluralistic government.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our tradition of separating church and state is rooted in the
        Constitution. By attempting to codify a particular Christian morality
        into law, Project 2025 would erode not only religious freedom but
        other fundamental rights — from bodily autonomy to equal protection.
        The plan’s authors may say they are securing “God‑given rights,” but
        rights that apply only to a select few are not rights at all; they are
        privileges【364449537505205†L147-L166】.
      </p>
      <h2>The path forward</h2>
      <p>
        Facts, not fear, must guide our response. The danger of Project 2025
        lies in its substance, not in who wrote it. We owe it to ourselves
        and our neighbours to read the plan, understand its implications and
        spread the word. Support organisations that defend separation of
        church and state, such as Americans United for Separation of Church
        and State or the Interfaith Alliance. Attend school board meetings and
        oppose policies that impose a particular religious view on public
        education. Vote for representatives who respect pluralism and the
        Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the “We Rise” manifesto reminds us, authoritarianism often cloaks
        itself in words like “order” and “tradition.” We must be alert to
        proposals that promise moral certainty while stripping away the
        freedom to think, believe and love differently【819044182704204†L137-L159】.
        Our strength lies in unity across differences. Together we rise — not to
        tear down faith, but to ensure that faith cannot be weaponised to
        control others.
